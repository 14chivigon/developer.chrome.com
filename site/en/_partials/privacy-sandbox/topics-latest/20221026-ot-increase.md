Chrome has started to [increase traffic](/blog/privacy-sandbox-origin-trial-increase/)
for the [Privacy Sandbox Relevance and Measurement origin trial](/origintrials/#/view_trial/771241436187197441), including Topics, from 1% of Chrome Stable traffic to 5%. The trial has been
available in Chrome Stable since August, and feedback from early testers has helped improve API
stability so that we can now expand the trial population to continue functional testing through 2022
and prepare for utility testing in 2023. Stay tuned for more detailed utility testing guidance to
help testers evaluate the Topics API for their use cases. If you'd like to receive notifications

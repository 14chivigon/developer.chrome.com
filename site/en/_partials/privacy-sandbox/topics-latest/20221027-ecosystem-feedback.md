As part of our commitments to the
[CMA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/competition-and-markets-authority),
Chrome publishes quarterly feedback reports on the Privacy Sandbox proposals,
summarizing feedback received from the various sources including GitHub Issues,
the [Privacy Sandbox feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePSeywmcwuxLFsttajiv7NOhND1WoYtKgNJYxw_AGR8LR1Dg/viewform),
meetings with industry stakeholders, and web standards forums. The 2022 Q3
report includes [Topics feedback themes](/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/report-2022-q3/#topics)
such as the accuracy of the Topics system for inferring topics of interest from
hostnames, the granularity of the Topics Taxonomy and the usefulness of Topics
for various types and sizes of websites. (Past reports:

To help consolidate information about Topics testing, we've created a
[Tester List page on GitHub](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/blob/main/topics-tester-list.md)
where Topics testers can identify themselves and link to their learnings. This
list is voluntary and self-reported, so we don't expect it will be complete or
representative of all testing activityâ€”but we hope it will be a useful hub for
testers who are willing to share their insights with the community and inspire
others to get involved. If you are testing Topics or making plans to test,
please add your organization to the list. You'll find detailed instructions on
the page.
